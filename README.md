This is an attempt to clone the popular NY Times game WORDLE in java, 
this project was made to test my knowledge as well as utilize my java programming skills on a fun project. However it isn't as constrained as the actual game 
where users are only allowed to input real words and not any combination of letters. 

NOTE: In the MyDictionary class,  String filePath =  "C:\\Users\\favya\\IdeaProjects\\myWorkspace\\src\\Wordle\\Dictionary.txt"; should be changed to whatever folder you have the dictionary.txt file.
